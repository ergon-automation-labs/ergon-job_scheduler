# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working with `bot_army_job_scheduler`.

⚫ **STATUS: INACTIVE/SCAFFOLDED** — This bot is not currently in active development. It is scaffolded for potential future use (job scheduling functionality). All active work is focused on `bot_army_job_applications` (Job Application Tracking Bot).

---

## Purpose

**bot_army_job_scheduler** is the job scheduling and management bot implementation.

Handles:
- Job scheduling and timing management
- Execution orchestration
- Status tracking and reporting
- Error handling and retries

## Core Dependencies

- **bot_army_core** - NATS envelope decoding, schema validation
- **nats** - NATS client for message publishing/subscribing
- **jason** - JSON encoding/decoding
- **logger_json** - Structured JSON logging

The bot depends on schemas deployed by `bot_army_schemas_job` at `/etc/bot_army/schemas/job/`

---

## Development Workflow

### Setup

```bash
mix deps.get
mix test
```

### Key Modules to Implement

1. **BotArmyJobScheduler.NATS.Consumer** - Subscribe to NATS subjects
2. **BotArmyJobScheduler.Handlers.ScheduleHandler** - Handle job scheduling
3. **BotArmyJobScheduler.Handlers.ExecutionHandler** - Manage job execution
4. **BotArmyJobScheduler.Handlers.StatusHandler** - Track job status

### Message Subjects

The bot listens to and publishes:
- `job.schedule.*` - Job scheduling operations
- `job.execution.*` - Job execution operations
- `job.status.*` - Job status updates

All messages follow the core envelope structure from `bot_army_core`.

---

## Testing

```bash
mix test                    # Run all tests
mix test --cover            # With coverage
mix credo                   # Linting
mix dialyzer                # Static analysis
```

---

## Deployment

This bot is deployed via Salt from `bot_army_infra`:

```bash
cd ../bot_army_infra
make deploy-bot BOT=job
```

Deployment happens after:
1. Core schemas deployed
2. bot_army_core library deployed

## Agent Workflow Pattern

**Effective use of Claude Code agents when developing this bot.**

This follows the polyrepo agent strategy documented in `bot_army_infra/CLAUDE.md`.

### When to Use Haiku Agents

- Exploring handler implementations and understanding existing patterns
- Reading test files to understand expected behavior
- Diagnostics: checking test failures, understanding error logs
- Code search: finding specific handlers or NATS subjects
- Verification: running tests, checking message flow

**Why**: Fast iteration loop, perfect for understanding how other bots are structured.

### When to Use Sonnet Agents

- Implementing new handlers or business logic
- Designing complex scheduling algorithms and execution strategies
- Multi-handler integrations and message routing
- Refactoring handlers for new requirements
- Performance optimizations

**Why**: Deep reasoning ensures handlers are correct, scheduling logic is sound, and error cases are handled.

### Example: Add New Job Execution Strategy

```
User: "Add parallel job execution with dependency tracking"
  ↓
1. Haiku (Explore): Read existing execution_handler.ex, understand current execution model
  ↓
2. Sonnet (Plan): Design parallel execution strategy, identify state changes needed
   Plan dependency graph resolution, failure handling
  ↓
3. Sonnet (Implement): Update execution handler, add dependency tracking, add tests
  ↓
4. Haiku (Verify): Run test suite, check message flow and timing
```
